## Alternative Ways to use YouTube

* [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/)

FreeTube is a wonderful piece of software that installs onto your laptop or
desktop. You do not need to sign in and you are able to make multiple local
profiles. You can allow your family members to make their own profile to
follow their favorite channels or you can make a profile for each of your
interests. I make different profiles for news, Linux, Coding, ect. This
allows me to quickly change my feed to my current interests or projects.

Unfortunatly Freetube is not great at accessing age restricted content
but most videos and streams work just fine.

* [Piped](https://piped.video/trending)
* [Invidious](https://invidious.io/)

Piped and Invidious are powerful frontend alternative for YouTube. It acts as a
server side proxy. This prevents YouTube from connecting to the user directly
and collecting any data. They block all ads and allows users to follow
channels and create playlists.

There are public instances that you can use but you can also install the
software onto your own server to take complete control of the experience.

IF you are currently watching YouTube, none of these are bad options.
You can try all of these and see which gives you an enjoyable experience. If
one inspires you then set it as your default and take a little adventure.
