# It Doesn't Get Easier Than This

Internet browsers are mostly made up of the same 2 frameworks,
Chromium and Firefox. There are others but for the most part you will use one
or the other. Both support 2 must have extensions.

* [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)
* [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)

* [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/browser-extensions/)

These 2 browser extensions block ads, tracking and fingerprinting. They are
both easy to toggle on and off and can be configured to fit your needs.
Read up on these 2 extensions, try them get used to them.

Now while these do a lot to block tracking from the site side they do not
protect you from your browser. Browsers do collect a certian amount of data
on users. How they use that data is a different question.

## The Absolute No Nos

Google Chrome is the most egregous data collector. You may have seem
Manifest V3 meantioned on uBlocks website. In short Manifest V3 is a platform
for extensions that restricts how effective ad blockers can be. Google Chrome
runs Manifest V3 so extensions alone can't save you. Its time to say good bye.

Microsoft Edge Must also be abandoned. Feel free to do your own research
but there is no reason to use Microsoft when there are far better options.

Brave Browser and Brave Search are popular alternatives, especially within the
privacy community. While this guide encourages baby steps and avoids debate,
it's important to acknowledge that Brave has been involved in
several controversies.

Thereâ€™s a significant difference between being mediocre at privacy and engaging
in deceptive practices. Brave has been caught running fake fundraising campaigns
for developers without their consent and injecting hidden affiliate links into
users' URLs for kickback scams. These actions put Brave in the same category as
Google and Microsoft.

## The Yeah Yeahs

You may notice that some of these browsers use Chromium as a base. Chromium
is made by Google but that doesn't mean it's off the table like Google
Chrome. Chromium is Open Source meaning people can examine the code, use
it and build something better. This is called forking. Many privacy nuts
swear by chromium based browsers.

My list is in no particular order. My preferance is Firefox but any of
these is a great choice.

### Firefox and Forks of Firefox

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

The tried and true OG and my personal favorite. Firefox has been a long
standing open source project. It's code is reviewed endlessly by privacy
nuts and it's become a base for many great privacy focused browsers.

IF you are currently running Google Chrome, none of these are bad options.
You can install as many of these as you want and try them out. If one
inspires you then set it as your default and take a little adventure.
