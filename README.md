# SEIZING THE MEANS OF PERSONAL COMPUTING

## Preamble

Seizing The Means Through Personal Computing is a series that covers basic steps
for first timers to take in the world of degoogle, privacy and free and opensource
software (FOSS). This is not meant for people with experience in the FOSS community.
There should be no debates or arguing within this series. We are not persuing perfection.
I encourage followers to comment each week with what baby step they took and to celebrate
the baby steps of others. Privacy is a snowball and once you set it in motion you
will improve how you see fit.

## Seize the means tho... really?

Yes. The FOSS community while not necesarily leftwing is very active in taking power
back from corporations. Siezing the means is a foundational purpose to the movement.
Now in this series not every solution offered will be open source. In fact some
of the solutions offered may not be privacy respecting. The goal is disruption.
You can take small steps to change your digital foot print... and then you can
take more steps again... and again. Just start now.

## Ethical Consumption

No ethical consumption under capitalism has never meant that we do not try. It
means even the smallest effort is a revolutionary act. There is ZERO reason
to continue using FANG corporations. We all know this so im calling my self
out and im calling you out. Lets get to work!

## WHAT IS A GITHUB?

Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket and other platforms are cloud based repository services.
These are places where coders store, maintain and distribute their software. A lot
of open source projects are distributed on these repositories. I am hosting this
guide on Github so that first timers can get used to the feeling of interacting
with a simple repository. There are many ways to install, fork, download or clone
software from repositories and there is no one way I can teach you. You will have
to treat each one as a learning experience. Don't worry, its ussually quite easy
and we got some time before thats necessary.
