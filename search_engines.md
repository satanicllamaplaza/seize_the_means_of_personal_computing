# Search Engines Used to be Fun and Weird

## Now They're Just Weird

Once Uppon a time we could ask a magical butler for search results and he
was correct 40% of the time. We had a wealth of options to search with
and each one had it's own charater and results. These days most people
use Google... and it's **TRASH**.

I am not going to cover SEO(search engine optimization), ads and ai
answers in this post. Just know that all 3 of those "enhancments"
ruined your ability to learn and find accurate information.

* [How Google RUINED the Internet - Adam Conover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7NHABs76mg)

In this post I am going to cover some of the functionality of these search
engines but mostly I am going to show you good alternative and some fun
search engines that you should keep around for the whimsey.

## The Absolute No Nos

We all know Google is the worste offender when it comes to privacy and data
collection. Google tracks every search you make, every app you look at,
every step you take, every document you write (within Googles services of course.)

* [What Does Google Know About You](https://www.whatismyip.com/what-does-google-know-about-me/)

Bing is another major offender. Any service offered by Microsoft is laden with
privacy invading telemitry, tracking and data collection. Microsoft has been
a terribly evil corporation for longer than some of us have been alive. It's
time to say good bye.

Why the hell not FCK Yahoo too.. lol.

## The Yeah Yeahs

Again this is in no particular order. Any of these are a great choice
if you are switching from Google or Bing.

### Conventional Search Engines

* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
* [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)

DuckDuckGo and StartPage have been popular starting point for many people and
despitea few stepbacks have managed to maintain some respect from privacy focused
communities.

* [Brave](https://search.brave.com/)

* [Swisscows](https://swisscows.com/en)

Swisscows is based in Switserland. The search engine is known to restrict NSFW
content. Swisscows charges for other internet services such as email which is
a great indicator that they take privacy seriusly.

* [Marginalia](https://marginalia-search.com/)

Marginalia is a beloved Search Engine for may privacy nerds. It is open source,
prioritizes non-commercial content and takes privacy seriously. It will not perform
in the ways you are used to but it is a gem that finds gems. It's a great wild card
to have on hand.

* [SearxNG](https://docs.searxng.org/)
* [Public SearxNG Instances](https://searx.space/)

SearxNG is the cream of the crop! It can be self hosted allowing you to make a
private search engine accesible by you alone. It is a meta search engine meaning
it uses the the results of many search engines to give you a thorogh output. It
filters out ads and trackers. If you can't host it yourself you can use public
instances. Keep in mind that you never know who is running those public instances.

* [Kagi](https://kagi.com/)

Kagi is a newer engine that is highly respected for its results. It blocks ads
and SEO. It requires an account which concerns some people and depending on how
much you search you may need to pay for it. Paying for a webservice is a good
thing. It gives places a way to make money outside of data collection and
disensentivises the company from breaking your trust. I pay for Kagi and it is
worth every penny... but I search ALOT!

* [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com/)
* [Gigablast](https://gigablast.org/)

### Unconventional Search Engines

These are going to be geared more towards finding more creative, unique or specific
sides of the internet.

expression, the more humane web.

* [searchmysite](https://searchmysite.net/)

Search real content by real people from the indieweb / the small web / digital

a search as a service.

* [wiby](https://wiby.me/)

The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days
of the internet. In addition, Wiby helps vintage computers to continue browsing
the web, as pages indexed are more suitable for their performance.

IF you are currently using Google or Bing, none of these are bad options.
If one inspires you then set it as your default and take a little adventure.
